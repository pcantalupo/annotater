Bugs

Nov 2012
I tried running Reann with Taxonomy on the set of sewage sequences and I got
the following error that I have not been able to fix:

  perl(85839) malloc: *** mmap(size=2043740160) failed (error code=12)
  *** error: can't allocate region
  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
  Out of memory!



Finished
12.3.12 (fixed in Feb 2012 on commit c4a4d5d540028)
Reann->Taxonomy method invokes a separate call to blastdbcmd for each gi.
This is slow and should be changed to a batch call.
